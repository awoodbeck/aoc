# Advent of Code

My goal is to keep things as simple as possible and not over-engineer the
solutions.

## 2020
This year, I am using Go for the solutions with the intention of going back
and writing solutions in Rust, as time allows, since I have yet to write
anything more than a "Hello, world!" in Rust.
